# Quality Gates

1. Build: `yarn build` must succeed before merging.
2. Types: `yarn type-check` must be clean (no errors).
3. Lint: `yarn lint` with zero errors (warnings acceptable if justified).
4. Tests: Add/adjust tests for new logic; no unrelated test breakage.
5. Security: No secrets committed; env keys documented.
6. Performance: No obvious N+1 or unbounded queries introduced.
7. Accessibility (frontend): New UI components must have labels/roles as appropriate.
8. Backwards Compatibility: Migrations are additive; note any breaking changes explicitly.
9. Docs: Update README / SCHEMA.md / ENVIRONMENT docs for changed public behavior.
10. Review: Keep PR scope tight; include summary + checklist mapping to these gates.
