# Roadmap Discipline

1. Phases: Implement features strictly in current phase (see `Roadmap.md`).
2. Out-of-Scope Requests: Document and defer unless they unblock current milestone.
3. Minimal Viable: Prefer shipping a thin vertical slice over broad incomplete scaffolding.
4. Tech Debt: Track as TODO comments + issues; don't silently accumulate.
5. Metrics: For performance or DB related changes, note baseline and expected improvement in PR.
6. Feature Flags: Gate experimental features; remove flags once stable.
7. Cleanup: Remove unused code/feature toggles at phase transitions.
